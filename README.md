# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
Repo for C# and .Net Framework projects.

This is a short list of some projects that are included in this repository.  

Car Insurance
This is an MVC application that acts as a car insurance quote calculator.  It takes in information from the user and based off of the input, will calculate a quote for car insurance.  There is also an admin page that displays the quotes calculated and the user's information for that quote.  

Casino
This is a casino style game of BlackJack built with MVC and .Net Framework. This application functions from user input and randomizes the cards in a way that mimics the actions of a casino card dealer.  This is a good time killer.
